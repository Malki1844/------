# Recipe Management System

## Overview

In this project, I developed a comprehensive recipe management system using a combination of modern technologies. The project integrates Python with Flask for server-side operations and Angular 17 with Angular Material for the client-side interface.

## Backend

The backend of the application is built using Python with Flask. Flask was used to create a robust server that interacts with a SQL Server database through `pyodbc`. This setup allows efficient data management, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting recipes.

## Frontend

On the client side, Angular 17 was employed along with Angular Material to design a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface. Angular Material provides advanced UI components that enhance the overall user experience.

## Asynchronous Data Management

For handling asynchronous data streams, I utilized Observable. Observable helps manage data that arrives asynchronously, such as server responses, in a flexible and efficient manner. This ensures that the user interface updates dynamically and promptly as new data is received from the server.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side**: Built with Flask and connected to SQL Server using `pyodbc`.
- **Client-Side**: Developed with Angular 17 and Angular Material for an intuitive and responsive UI.
- **Asynchronous Handling**: Utilizes Observable for managing asynchronous data streams.

The project effectively combines these technologies to deliver a complete solution for managing recipes, featuring a well-designed user interface, smooth user experience, and advanced data management capabilities.
